# Analytics in the Age of JavaScript

Goals:
 - something to add to redux-beacon's readme under "motivation"
 - something to send to people wondering what problems redux-beacon solves
 - something to generate leads...companies migrating to a SPA that wants the same analytics they had
 
Pitch:
Implementing analytics in SPAs is hard, Redux and global state makes it easier.

Notes:
 - traditional sites, every change is a page load
 - most analytics services are build for traditional sites
 - adding analytics in a sustainable way
 - global state vs local state, free analytics, another benefit
 - implementing analytics is very important, a lot hinges on it, business
   decisions.
 - not an afterthought
 - analytics driven development
 - sites with the slideshows where each slide had a different route
 - implementing analytics has to be done with as much care and attention to
   detail as adding any other JavaScript
 - what about SSR?
 - what about code splitting?
 - building out a feature not worth tracking? A means of prioritization.
 - if its not worth tracking is it even worth building?
 - "legacy page-by-page approach"

 - server-side (logs) vs client side analytics
