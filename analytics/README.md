# Analytics in the Age of JavaScript

Notes:
 - traditional sites, every change is a page load
 - most analytics services are build for traditional sites
 - adding analytics in a sustainable way
 - global state vs local state, free analytics, another benefit
 - implementing analytics is very important, a lot hinges on it, business
   decisions.
 - not an afterthought
 - analytics driven development
 - sites with the slideshows where each slide had a different route
 - implementing analytics has to be done with as much care and attention to
   detail as adding any other JavaScript
 - what about SSR?
 - what about code splitting?
